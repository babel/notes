# Oct 18 notes

Attendees: @nicolo-ribaudo @JLHwung @liuxingbaoyu

- 7.20.0 - Small, but do not wait too long because people are excited about TS `expr satisfies X`
  - https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/14966 not included in mileston because big and might need some discussion, no need to block the release

- Babel 8
  - We potentially ready to publish a pre-release, but would like to first include all the big missing breaking changes
  - AST changes: ImportExpression, https://github.com/babel/babel/issues/9545 (typescript-eslint/typescript-estree: https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/tree/main/packages/typescript-estree)
  - ESM only?
    - A bit hesitant about it, but probably fine?
      - webpack, rollup, @babel/cli already use Babel asynchronously
      - @babel/register and @babel/eslint-parser work with the ESM version
      - Jest might have problems?
    - CJS for some packages that are used outside of Babel, like `@babel/parser` and `@babel/code-frame`
   - If moving stable plugin to @babel/core, we shouldn't publish version 8 of them (e.g. no `@babel/plugin-transform-arrow-functions@8.0.0`)
   - For maintainance, use 2 branches.
     - Only security fixes for Babel 7, and maybe normal fixes if companies sponsor us for that?
     - What about security fixes that require upgradig a dependency that drops an old Node.js version?
       - We can release `7.20.3-nodejs12` to signal that the fix requires Node.js 12
       - It would be nice if you can specify a dependency as `"3 || 4"` and the package manager downloads the highest compatible with the current Node.js version (npm has it! https://github.com/npm/rfcs/blob/main/implemented/0023-acceptDependencies.md) (Check if yarn / pnpm are going to support this)
