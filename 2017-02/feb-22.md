## Feb 22 ([discuss](https://github.com/babel/notes/pull/15))

Just wanted to write up some quick high level updates.

### Babel 7 updates

- [Planning for Babel 7](https://github.com/babel/babel.github.io/pull/1166): What's going on so far.
- [Upgrade to Babel 7](https://github.com/babel/babel.github.io/pull/1146): Will post this soon and update as we go along for people that want to use it early.

Will do a few pre-releases to test; need to think about upgrade path for oss libraries and everyone else.
