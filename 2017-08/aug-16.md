# Babel Team Meeting - 2017-08-16

## Attendees

- Peeyush
- Emma
- Kara
- Logan
- Henry

## Discussion

- Peeyush: Decorators PR helpers use ES6 so it fails on Node 4.
  - Ideally we would compile the helpers separately to ES5 or do it based on preset-env/babelrc
  - Logan: Constant issue of what should we do right now for 7.x vs. later?
  - Logan: had earlier PR https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/5706, brought up the issues we had with compiling `typeof` helper on itself recursively.
  - Conclusion: may need to write in ES5 (or always compile down to ES5) for the moment.
- Henry: been busy and giving a talk at [React Rally](https://reactrally.com) next week 
- Emma: working on codemod for let/const
  - Henry: Brian had a suggestion for a codemod for decorators: `@foo export default class {}`
- Henry: Logan/someone should switch all the repos from `7.0` to `master` and `master` back to `6.x`. (Let's use `master` in the future, and `x.y` for any backports).
- Will post Karl's post. Done: https://twitter.com/left_pad/status/897890141171101696
