## RC

- [ ] Logan: Separate out helpers/core-js/runtime: https://github.com/babel/babel/issues/8155
  - `babel-runtime` (default) and `babel-runtime-corejs2` both have helpers, but only `core-js` one has `core-js` included. Also add a `babel-runtime-corejs3`
  - Logan: almost done, need to update test files.
- [ ] Blocker: Ignore/Only support on Windows https://github.com/babel/babel/issues/8184
  - Remove pattern matching in `ignore/only/test/include/exclude`, new recommendation is to use a regex in a `.js` config.
- [ ] Move yearly/stage presets directly into `babel-standalone` or update website to allow selecting a "stage", which would enable plugins.
- [ ] Henry: Remove Stage and yearly presets https://github.com/babel/babel/issues/7770
  - Update stage presets with a warning/deprecation message "here are the plugins you will want to include" and possibly mention (and add) babel-upgrade support?
    1. Publish new releases of yearly and stage presets (no changes), and ensure that they have deprecation warnings on npm.
    2. Remove code from presets and have them throw helpful errors telling people what packages they _would_ have been using, and publish (maybe as RC release).

## Misc

- [ ] Team: do a run through of existing PRs if anything was missed
  - TODO: Schedule a time for the team to run through everything, shoot for next Monday since holidays.
- [ ] Change bundling standalone to only on "production" build (saves on local/CI build time since it only needs to happen per release).
- [ ] Henry: Outlined the release post
- RGSoC kickoff/starting today!
