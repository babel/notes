# 4/15

## [Attendees](https://babeljs.io/team):

- Nicol√≤ ([@nicolo-ribaudo](https://github.com/nicolo-ribaudo))
- J√πnli√†ng ([@JLHwung](https://github.com/JLHwung))
- Brian ([@existentialism](https://github.com/existentialism))
- Henry ([@hzoo](https://github.com/hzoo))
- Jordan ([@ljharb](https://github.com/ljharb)) (guest: es-shims, tc39)

## Polyfill story

- [ ] Nicol√≤: Make the polyfills plugins repo public to get feedback from the community 
    - Currently figuring out best way to make a combined package, since there are tradeoffs for having separate ones.
    - Finishing up ES6 polyfills still, everything up to ES7 is done. [Support List](https://github.com/nicolo-ribaudo/babel-polyfills/tree/master/packages/babel-plugin-polyfill-es-shims#babel-plugin-polyfill-es-shims)
      - Jordan: also show the gap between the supported feature vs. full spec in the support list
    - Jordan: make it easy to replace `core-js`/`es-shims`/`babel helpers` (issue of having to have `object-assign` vs. `object.assign` in the ecosystem)
    - Henry: prepare a simple writeup on main points of this, current status, goals/future for feedback (mention that Denis was on board with this and helped out in making it) - aka finish a readme before making public so it makes sense.
    - Nicol√≤: question about allowing others to help with the polyfill efforts and future.
- Nicol√≤ - Regarding `compat-table`: we should split the columns for Babel and `core-js`. Also update our compat-table data esp. via 7.9, maybe update it automatically later?
- Figure out story around spec compliancy and correctness with polyfills (maybe tie that into how we think about loose mode üò±)
- Make a list of people to reach out to specifically for feedback so they see it. Jordan, WebReflection, polyfill.io, etc? (maybe can work with new version of `rollup-plugin-babel`). 

## Babel 8

- [Release Plan](https://github.com/babel/babel/issues/10746), review PRs!
- Justin: Renaming some proposal-* plugins to transform-*
  - J√πnli√†ng: We can do it now and rewrite proposal-* as a shell package which delegates to transform-*. in Babel 8 we can archive these shell package.

## RFCs

> Update: made at https://github.com/babel/rfcs

- Discuss about an official RFC policy
    - Follow ESLint's [practices](https://github.com/eslint/rfcs), mainly community RFCs need a champion from the team
    - Bar between github issue and RFC: 
        * new syntax proposals can just be regular issues. Feature request is RFC
- RFCs ideas from the team:
    - Move `targets` to the top-level options (`@nicolo-ribaudo`)
        * Reach out to parcel team for `targets` usage
    - Move `@babel/preset-env` into `@babel/core` (depends on above)
    - J√πnli√†ng: Allow plugin specific config to be overridden in `@babel/preset-env`
      - Henry: wondering about preset options in general vs. specifically for preset-env, or for the future why we even need to distinguish the two?
    - Versioning changes (what we are already doing but more explicit)
- Maybe merge the RFCs repo with the `babel/proposals` repo (we haven't been updating it much)? They are similar

## Move `preset-modules` to `preset-env` and archive `preset-modules`

- Henry: Just talk to Jason about this
    - J√πnli√†ng: Move preset-modules/bugfixes internal plugins under names of preset-env
    - Archive @babel/preset-modules, issues should be either trasferred or closed
    - Jason: need to figure out how to run the cross browser tests if we move it.
