## `targets` to top level

> Feedback on https://github.com/babel/rfcs/pull/2 (Nicolò)

```
// TL;DR
{
  "targets": ">1%, not ie 11",
  "presets": ["@babel/preset-env"]
}
```

- PLEASE REVIEW!
- In chat: some agreement on keeping the `targets` option as an abstraction (from `preset-env`) vs. only allowing browserslist
- `targets` should be passed on (resolved to browsers) to plugins/presets so they can be used to inform output (maybe this ties into "assumptions/capabilities" -> example: a transform plugin handles async so output it)

## Optional Chaining AST Discussion in ESTree

> Building consensus on https://github.com/estree/estree/pull/204#issuecomment-624441739 (Jùnliàng)

- A different AST shape would play better with the ["eventual send"](https://github.com/JLHwung/estree/blob/add-wavy-dot/experimental/wavy-dot.md) proposal
  - We could actually change `OptionalCallExpression`/`OptionalMemberExpression` to just `ChainCallExpresion`/`ChainMemberExpression` nodes (using the same member/call AST tree shape), and add wavy dot boolean to those nodes. A smaller breaking change, since it's just a node name change
- Possibility of using a ["virtual ast node"](https://github.com/babel/babel/blob/master/packages/babel-traverse/src/path/lib/virtual-types.js) like an alias for backwards compatibility?
- Henry: Need general policy that explicitly states our AST may/will change in proposals before Stage 4 (this is assumed atm)
- Research on the usage of `OptionalCallExpression` and help with the transition
- Current AST cannot represent difference between `a?.b?.c` and `(a?.b)?.c`.
  - Proposed `ChainingExpression` has same difficulty?
- Make a draft PR to test out the [`ChainingExpression` approach](https://gist.github.com/mysticatea/836541ec47613d599f6aef1ac4965d05#file-chaining-expression-md), and give feedback whether or not it actually improves things vs. the current transform. (use repl/codesandbox link)
- Justin: should be able to just tweak/rename current Babel AST to fit.
    - Henry: maybe should push for that given we have experience in implementation and a lot of users on this already

## Dynamic Import AST change (would be breaking)

> Feedback on https://github.com/babel/rfcs/pull/4 (Jùnliàng)

- Original PR is from https://github.com/babel/babylon/pull/163, so we used to have a separate node `Import` which is similar to this proposal vs. current `CallExpression`
- Possibly internalize a version of the `babel-plugin-dynamic-import-node` that uses the new AST shape?
- Please review RFC!

## Persistent File Cache (not just for config)

> Feedback on https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/11508 (Justin)

- Babel has a cache on config lookup but not the transformed output.
- Think about `babel-loader`'s cache: https://github.com/babel/babel-loader/blob/master/src/cache.js (`.cacheDirectory`)
- Needs to be opt-in for now since can't guarantee version changes to plugin/presets will bust the cache key. (inline plugins, versions, options, etc)
- Alias `api.cache` to `api.configCache`, and add `api.persistentCache`? Maybe `api.transformCache`

## Investigate using TypeScript in our code

- We have a community member, [@zxbodya](https://github.com/zxbodya) who has already done a lot of work/investigation into moving over to TS on a branch. We may have different assumptions/goals though, like not changing our API/code just to fit the types and cause more breaking changes.
- Nicolò worked with jest team on their own internal plugins and working with types for developing Babel plugins has been helpful
- Transition may not be too difficult: most types are in `@babel/core` which doesn't have as many PRs to it so start from that and `@babel/parser`, `@babel/traverse`. The rest (plugins) can be done by anyone?
- Henry: how to iterate over plugin options? config options? need schema/validation
- Brian: audit when we are add properties on AST nodes still (instead of WeakMap) like `node._blockHoist`

## Open Collective UI changes

> Henry: OC has some updates on the UI (just to mention it and maybe give a review) https://github.com/opencollective/opencollective-frontend/pull/4119

- Not much to do other than maybe give feedback? Need to verify that it is accurately calculating the monthly amount vs. annual. In our case, we'd like to know the recurring amount since last month as a guage to how we are doing.

## REPL/Docs ideas

> Henry: showing REPL stuff with codesandbox ([example](https://codesandbox.io/s/babel-plugin-options-only-wci0w)) - what else can we do with this?

![](https://i.imgur.com/5HDxMLB.png)

- Henry: already integrated in our PRs like the REPL link
    - Example comment: https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/11533#issuecomment-625262555
- Writing a custom plugin: https://codesandbox.io/s/babel-repl-custom-plugin-7s08o
- Comparing the output of two configs: https://codesandbox.io/s/babel-plugin-multi-config-vhm64
- A page for each plugin to show the different outputs of our options (currently hardcoded since no schema for plugin options) + filesize: https://codesandbox.io/s/babel-plugin-filesize-cfo0h
- Henry: Thinking about a diff view of AST/output for PRs
