- [x] Can we reschedule meetings starting from the next one? (@nicolo-ribaudo)
  - Doodle? Nicolo: Tuesday 11:30am EST
  - Ask Logan and Sven if it works for them
- [x] Babel's accounts management (website/email/bot)
  - Write all places we have accounts
  - Shared accounts/passwords, maybe it's multi-user?
  - formal adding/removing access for github/slack/etc?
- [x] Decide on PR (@danez): File size badges https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/7960
  - More helpful as automation/regression (actionable to reduce size), not a readme which just leads to misunderstanding/confusion (it's a devDependency). It doesn't tell you why/what actually caused the size increase, and it's unrelated to Babel's output size (easy to conflate the two).
  - More interesting is benchmarks for test coverage, build perf, test262, output size, etc.
- [x] Should fix? (hzoo)
  - REPL/codesandbox/bundling
  - https://twitter.com/stefanpenner/status/1099751798384914432
  - Release babel-eslint v11 stable?
    - Just go with the PR and change later.
- [x] Decorators update (@nicolo-ribaudo)
- [x] Next release: v7.4.0
  - Patch version today
  - Revert parenthesized expression PR (and merge it again later for 7.4.0)
  - Minor version next weeks
