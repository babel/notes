- [ ] Configuration files extensions (@nicolo-ribaudo)
  - We currently allow `.babelrc`, `.babelrc.{js,cjs}` and `babel.config.{json,js,cjs}`
  - `babel.config.mjs` and `.babelrc.mjs`? ([issue](https://github.com/babel/babel/issues/10755))
    - Depends on https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/10507
    - `.mjs` can only be loaded asynchronously
    - Performance is similar
    - ESLint only works with the synchronous version (https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/10507#discussion_r331786481)
        - Throw an error when babel config uses .mjs extension
    - **Resolution**: Consensus in the room
  - `.babelrc.json`? ([Slack discussion](https://babeljs.slack.com/archives/C062RC35M/p1575072160232800), [issue](https://github.com/babel/babel/issues/10782), [pr](https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/10783))
    - ESLint did something similar - the extensionless version is deprecated in the docs
    - No downsides in doing it, except for "one more possible config file"
    - **Resolution**: Consensus in the room
- [x] `@babel/eslint-* v8` (https://github.com/babel/babel/issues/10752)
  - Nicolò: every other integration allows passing options directly
  - `@babel/esint-parser` is only for parsing, enabling transform plugins might be confusing
  - If we decide _not_ to enable it, we can enable it later in a minor release
  - **Resolution**: not enable it for now, we can revise this decision later 
- [x] Minor additions to the "Babel 8 release plan" issue: (@nicolo-ribaudo)
  - [ ] Consider moving root AMD/UMD/SystemJS options to be plugin/preset options (https://github.com/babel/babel/issues/5473) - Taken from the [`Babel 7.next`](https://github.com/babel/babel/milestone/14) milestone.
    - **Resolution**: Need more context to decide if we should do it or not; the decision is postponed.
  - [ ] Make babel-node clearly separate arguments to node, babel-node, and the script being executed (https://github.com/babel/babel/issues/4373) - Taken from the [`Babel 7.next`](https://github.com/babel/babel/milestone/14) milestone.
    - **Resolution**: Need more context to decide if we should do it or not; the decision is postponed.
  - [ ] Clean up `@babel/types` (https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/5971) - Probably it's easier to rewrite this PR as many small PRs, they could all be `good first issue`s
    - This is risky, but safer checks are nice
    - We can add an env flag to enable the new checks in the next minor release. This would give the community the ability to test if their packages/dependencies would work with it in Babel 8.0.0
    - This will break _at least_ `react-native` (but we should send them a PR)
    - **Resolution**: If the rest of the teem agrees, let's add this flag in Babel 7.8.0
  - [ ] Disallow `babel.transform` used synchronously? ([comment in code](https://github.com/babel/babel/blob/db2a9fc96ebb2b29aaeedb962b46f5010a552f17/packages/babel-core/src/transform.js#L25-L27))
    - Currently there are `babel.transformSync` which is synchronous, `babel.transformAsync` which returns a promise, and `babel.transform` which accepts a callback.
    - `babel.transform` runs synchronously when the `callback` is not provided, for compatibility with Babel 6
    - Removing this overloading would possibly allow us to overload it to return a promise in the future
    - **Resolution**: we will add this flag to give tools (e.g. `react-native`) to test if they will work with Babel 8
  - @Andarist will post other ideas in the "Babel 8 Release Plan" issue
- [ ] Reposition babel-preset-env-standalone in Babel 8 (@JLHwung)
  - Large build size (1.3MB), limited extra functionalities (6 plugins)
  - Consider merge back to babel-standalone
      - Merging back to babel-standalone would not increase bundle size too much
      - Currently only our website is using babel-preset-env-standalone
   - **Resolution** copy functions in env-standalone to babel-standalone in 7.8, deprecate env-standalone in 7.8, remove it on 8.x
- [ ] Give the `triage` role to a Raja Sekar [**@rajasekarm**](https://github.com/rajasekarm)
