- [x] Tests status update (https://github.com/babel/babel/issues/4987, https://github.com/babel/babel/issues/10734)
  - Currently all the syntax tests from test262 (not built-ins) for both the parser and transforms via CircleCI (compares PR to master, so it should fail if new tests fail).
    - Prioritize fixes for failing tests which other browsers are passing (use test262.report?)
  - Working on more E2E tests (create-react-app), currently we run against Babel itself! Maybe instead of the library itself (react-native), find an open source application that uses it (reach out to community on this).
- [x] Print Babel Configuration (https://github.com/babel/babel/issues/10617)
  - Try to do a minimal version and iterate over it so people can benefit from it  
- [x] Babel 8 release plan published at [babel/babel#10746](https://github.com/babel/babel/issues/10746)
- [x] ESLint migration to the monorepo (https://github.com/babel/babel/issues/10709)
  - Packages renaming and versioning, potentially make changes at the same time as next minor/major. We can do it now and publish a new beta.
  - [x] Issue migration
    - We should wait until we are ready to release `@babel/eslint-parser`
    - Add a label to migrated issues
- Idea: we should create a page listing the conferences that we plan to attend
