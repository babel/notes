## Test262+babel+corejs integration

- Sven will setup integration so we can see our progress (too slow for CI)
- Could we store our results on https://test262.report somehow?

## Future of @babel/minify

> Responded earlier: https://twitter.com/left_pad/status/1100859277999247369
- Don't have enough people to maintain; it's a good idea that we may get to later but currently label as experimental.
- Merge: https://github.com/webpack-contrib/babel-minify-webpack-plugin/pull/85

## Podcast

- Henry: getting some Cover Art help now!
- Topics: Interview maintainers, maintainers of other Babel alternatives, TC39, etc? Other ideas, it's open!
- Just gotta start instead of just talking about it, will schedule some with everyone in the meeting soon (if up for it). Order some mics!
