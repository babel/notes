- [x] Setting up `estree` parser plugin policy for the linter, `@babel/eslint-parser` (@kaicataldo) [babel/babel#9506](https://github.com/babel/babel/issues/9506#issuecomment-564772125)
  - Only support Stage 4 features included in the [ESTree](https://github.com/estree/estree) spec. Stage <=3 features implemented in the Babel parser. Same story as for Babel itself, ESTree doesn't need to be different.
  - Need to work on central doc(s) for rules/standards/etc.
  - Henry: `/doc` folder has some old docs we could use again. Need to sync website with the repo? üò≠ Either way just need to start putting it somewhere.
- [x] How we should move forward with [`@babel/preset-modules`](https://github.com/babel/preset-modules)? (@developit)
	- Jason: Next.js has it on by default, maybe Gatsby in the future so there's been more traction.
	- Find definitions in `preset-env` that could be replaced by preset-modules to "integrate" the functionality in into a single preset.
	- Jason: And what about related polyfilling support rather than just syntax? What about Node?
	- Eventually: always apply `preset-modules` plugins where possible. `preset-env` should allow the overriding of `compat-table` data based on which of our plugins fix what issues.
	- Nicol√≤'s proposal: use it in Babel 7.8.0, hoping that it won't break anyone's build.
	- **Conclusion**: Use `@babel/preset-modules` on `esmodule: true`. In the future, use that logic also for `targets` using `compat-table`'s more granular data.
	- Henry: Should we set up a pipeline for bugs? In detail meaning going from a bug report in a browser to an issue repro/test case, to a fix/plugin in preset-modules, to it being covered by Babel in preset-env.
	    - Jason: Something where browsers could be more involved.
	    - Add a `bugs.json` in preset-env? We should iclude the test case.
      - Henry: maybe we should generate our own test data, have more incentive to be granular given we are using the data for real world usage vs. just for display on the site.
- [x] Tuples&Records parser support [babel/babel#10865](https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/10865) (@nicolo-ribaudo)
    - Boolean flags vs. enum for the syntax variant
    - Get feedback for different syntax types
    - **Resolution**: Use enum syntax.
- [x] Module attributes parser support (@nicolo-ribaudo)
    - Mandatory `version` option?
    - Write down babel's semver definition, like the one in ESLint: https://github.com/eslint/eslint#semantic-versioning-policy
- [x] PLEASE REVIEW: _"regenerator-runtime" import now can be controlled through include/exclude option_ (https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/10768)
- [x] Moving away from `make` (https://github.com/babel/babel/issues/10889) (@kaicataldo @nicolo-ribaudo)
    - Nicol√≤ ran a Twitter poll and found that ~50% of Windows users stopped contributing to an open source project due to struggling with `make`.
    - We should see if we can move away from `make` to lower the barrier for entry for contributors.
- [x] Funding status update
    - Maybe document or CRM-like system of who we're talking to re: funding for coordination?
    - Possibly a newsletter/update to better explain what we are doing (outside of blog post/changelog)
- [x] Prepare v7.8.0 (@nicolo-ribaudo)
    - We already have a lot of PRs ready. Before the end of this decade
- [x] Babel 8 Release Plan issues
    - [x] Disable submodule exports for packages with a single `lib/index.js` (https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/10850#issuecomment-564672825) (@JLHwung)
        - Just do it for all packages in v8?
        - Make target parser in preset-env available for other presets since that seems to be one of the more commonly used internals
    - [x] Consider moving root AMD/UMD/SystemJS options to be plugin/preset options (https://github.com/babel/babel/issues/5473) - Taken from the [`Babel 7.next`](https://github.com/babel/babel/milestone/14) milestone, discussed in #104 but postponed to this meeting (@JLHwung)
        - **Resolution**: Consensus in the room
    - [x] Do not change env target default when browserslists config presents (https://github.com/babel/babel/issues/9962) (@JLHwung)
        - **Resolution**: Consensus in the room
    - [x] Add mandatory `version` option to the decorators plugins, and merge the two plugins in `@babel/parser`. (@nicolo-ribaudo)
        - **Resolution**: Consensus in the room
    - [x] Don't use an ad-hoc CJS format to transpile Babel helpers (https://github.com/babel/babel/issues/10746#issuecomment-561510965) (presented by @nicolo-ribaudo on behalf of @Andarist)
        - **Resolution**: Consensus in the room
- [ ] Update [team](https://babeljs.io/team) section in babel website, pretty out of date. We should add some descriptions!
