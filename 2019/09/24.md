## News
- Tan Li Hau wrote two in-depth blog posts: one on [making a custom Babel transform](https://lihautan.com/step-by-step-guide-for-writing-a-babel-transformation/) and the other on [writing your own custom syntax](https://lihautan.com/creating-custom-javascript-syntax-with-babel/)
- Henry will be attending [Maintainers III unconference](http://themaintainers.org/miii) which is October 7-9 in Washington, DC - let us know if you'll be there or want to meet up to chat!
- Closed a lot of [`good-first-issue`s](https://github.com/babel/babel/issues?q=label%3Aclaimed+is%3Aclosed) and working on thinking about other approaches to helping out new/potential contributors.

## Babel 8 

- No huge changes.
- Preliminary talk on what that would look like and mean: current intention is that we want to take the opportunity to remove deprecated APIs and small breaking changes to the parser for specification reasons and nothing that should require a migration step for majority of people. So not like Babel 6 or even Babel 7.
- Nicolò brought up that Node 8 (which is LTS) will be [end-of-life in January](https://github.com/nodejs/Release#release-schedule) so we could do a major version then and drop that support.
- We have a [current milestone](https://github.com/babel/babel/milestone/16) for this.
  - The one that may affect people is related to the behavior of uninitialized class fields (`class A { a; }` and how it relates to Flow/TS: https://github.com/babel/babel/issues/10039 is mitigated by https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/9141
  - Also around a smaller change with comment attachment https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/9084
- As a general point: if possible we'd rather introduce new features in minor features and deprecate what is old, and then drop the old functionality in major versions.
  - Also given that Babel is a compiler, any change could be breaking (a bug in Babel that is incorrect according to the spec is relied upon by someone, so it does fix functionality but can be interpreted as a breaking change even if not intended). TS and ESLint have similar [policies](https://github.com/eslint/eslint#semantic-versioning-policy) in this way (minor versions can still break).
  - Henry asked about doing a beta but given that it's not a huge change this shouldn't be necessary.

## Misc

- `@babel/parser` test262 status update: we are almost fully compliant now, only a few left with open PRs if you check our [whitelist](https://github.com/babel/babel/blob/master/scripts/tests/test262/test262_whitelist.txt)! Also have some new/fixed tests for [`test262`](https://github.com/tc39/test262) itself.
- Talking about funding: we want to draft up a blog post to talk about how funding has been going, and our plans regarding maintainance of the project. Also want to work on a change to the Open Collective UI via https://github.com/opencollective/opencollective/issues/1585 to show recurring monthly revenue instead of the total amount for the last year (which skews one-time payments).
