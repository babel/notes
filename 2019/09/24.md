## News
- Tan Li Hau wrote two in-depth blog posts: one on [making a custom Babel transform](https://lihautan.com/step-by-step-guide-for-writing-a-babel-transformation/) and the other on [writing your own custom syntax](https://lihautan.com/creating-custom-javascript-syntax-with-babel/)
- Closed a lot of [`good-first-issue`s](https://github.com/babel/babel/issues?q=label%3Aclaimed+is%3Aclosed) and working on thinking about other approaches to helping out new/potential contributors.
