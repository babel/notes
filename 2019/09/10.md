## PRs

Nicolò:
- [Polyfills RFC, #10008](https://github.com/babel/babel/issues/10008): status update
  - TL;DR Take plugin from `preset-env/runtime` and extract out logic for polyfills to make it general. Also in contact with Jordan, polyfill.io, and other relevant parties!
  - Add an option to `useBuiltIns` like `@babel/transform-runtime`
  - We should add in some educational post about polyfills, Henry has an old unpublished one to start with.

Jùnliàng: 
- [Stage 1 slice notation PR, #10357](https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/10357): call for more reviewers
    - Henry will reach out to @gsathya, the champion as well
- A single `babel-plugin-regexpu` (?) to handle all unicode-awared regex transforms (https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/10347#issuecomment-522443635)
  - This is similar to our class features plugin merge? We would want to internally combine the plugins in one to fix some ordering issues, shouldn't be user visible. So we could do individual packages and a shared combined helper package!
  - Standardize on [`regexpu`](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/regexpu)? We are currently using it for everything except for named capturing groups.

## Misc

Henry:
- Suggestion: Jùnliàng has great perf work, maybe can turn into blog post or guide?
    - Ideas: showing how to dive into a large project, profiling it and having real performance wins (or just attempting it), point to the [parser-performance repo](https://github.com/babel/parser_performance)
    - Why parser performance matters, but also in another sense doesn't.
- We should record some more podcast episodes, especially on how everyone got started!
- Tan has started a WIP for a blog post on writing Babel plugins, coming soon!
- Better manage contributor access and onboarding/offboarding (moving people to alumni on github and removing from slack and other things) after inactivity. Write up in contributing guide.
    - Can also work on reducing number of github/npm teams
    - We should move most of our discussions to #development other than managerial/people/wip stuff
    - Maybe do an contributing hours type livestream/video in addition to our own meetings.
- Still talking with some other's on new features/packages for Babel, coming soon
