# Babel Notes

## Meetings

We have online meetings every two weeks, using Google Hangouts. Currently, we usually meet on Wednesdays at 20:30 UTC.
A few days before any meeting, we create an issue in [`babel/notes`](https://github.com/babel/notes/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3Ameeting+) containing the agenda.

If we don't meet, I usually post a summary of what's been going on (notable issues/PRs, etc).

New notes are added as pull requests (watch the repo!): feel free to comment on them!

## Communication

Most of our discussions happen in the [#development](https://babeljs.slack.com/messages/development)/[#discussion](https://babeljs.slack.com/messages/discussion) slack rooms. (Sign up at [slack.babeljs.io](http://slack.babeljs.io/))
