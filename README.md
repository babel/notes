# Babel Notes

## Meetings

> Please check out our [team page](https://babeljs.io/team)

We have online meetings every two weeks, using Google Hangouts. Currently, we usually meet on Wednesdays at 20:30 UTC.
A few days before any meeting, we create an issue in [`babel/notes`](https://github.com/babel/notes/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3Ameeting+) containing the agenda.

New notes are added as PRs (watch the repo): feel free to comment on them!

## Communication

Most of our technical discussions happen in the [#development](https://babeljs.slack.com/messages/development) slack room. (Sign up at [slack.babeljs.io](http://slack.babeljs.io/))

## Old Notes (2016)

> When we didn't have "meetings", but just notes to discuss development.
