# Babel Notes

## Meetings

> Please check out our [team page](https://babeljs.io/team)

We have online video meetings about every two weeks. Currently, we usually meet on Wednesdays at 20:30 UTC.
A few days before any meeting, we create an issue in [`babel/notes`](https://github.com/babel/notes/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+sort%3Aupdated-desc+label%3Ameeting+) containing the agenda.

New notes are added as PRs: feel free to comment on them!

## Communication

Most of our technical discussions happen in the [#development](https://babeljs.slack.com/messages/development) slack room. (Sign up at [slack.babeljs.io](http://slack.babeljs.io/)).

Minor/Major releases are covered on our [blog](https://babeljs.io/blog/), and larger features will be covered in our [RFCs](https://github.com/babel/rfcs) repo.

> Note: when we didn't have meetings, just wrote down notes to discuss development (started 7/30/16).
