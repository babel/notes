# Babel Notes

> We don't have "meetings" at the moment, but we do discuss the development.

> These notes started July 30, 2016.

Most of our talks happen in the [#development](https://babeljs.slack.com/messages/development)/[#discussion](https://babeljs.slack.com/messages/discussion) slack rooms. (Sign up at [slack.babeljs.io](http://slack.babeljs.io/))

We also have an archive of the rooms using slackarchive: https://babeljs.slackarchive.io/development/

New notes will be added as pull requests so you will be notified of them if you watch the repo.

You can comment on the pull requests to discuss the notes, or raise issues if you would like to ask for a clarification.
