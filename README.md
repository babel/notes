# Babel Notes

Currently, we do video chat on Wednesdays at 9:00 AM EST and 12:00 PM EST (switching between the times every other week). If we don't meet, I'll just post a summary of what's been going on (notable issues/PRs, etc).

New notes are added as pull requests (watch the repo!): feel free to comment on them!

To know about our team members, please check out our [team page](https://babeljs.io/team)!

## Communication

Most of our discussions happen in the [#development](https://babeljs.slack.com/messages/development)/[#discussion](https://babeljs.slack.com/messages/discussion) slack rooms. (Sign up at [slack.babeljs.io](http://slack.babeljs.io/))

We also have an archive of the rooms using slackarchive: https://babeljs.slackarchive.io/development/
