# Babel Notes

Currently, we do video chat on Wednesdays at 9:00 AM EST and 12:00 PM EST (switching between the times every other week).

New notes are added as pull requests (watch the repo!): feel free to comment on them!

We also have an archive of the rooms using slackarchive: https://babeljs.slackarchive.io/development/
