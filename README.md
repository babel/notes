# Babel Notes

To setup, we make a [PR on babel/notes](https://github.com/babel/notes/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed) and then setup a doodle for availability each week (and we make a Slack call or Google Hangouts for the chat). Currently, we usually do video chat on Mondays at 10:00 PM EST.

If we don't meet, I usually post a summary of what's been going on (notable issues/PRs, etc).

New notes are added as pull requests (watch the repo!): feel free to comment on them!
