# Babel Notes

To setup, we make a [PR on babel/notes](https://github.com/babel/notes/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed) and then setup a doodle for availability each week (and we make a Slack call or Google Hangouts for the chat). Currently, we usually do video chat on Mondays at 10:00 PM EST.

If we don't meet, I usually post a summary of what's been going on (notable issues/PRs, etc).

New notes are added as pull requests (watch the repo!): feel free to comment on them!

> To know about our team members, please check out our [team page](https://babeljs.io/team)!

## Communication

Most of our discussions happen in the [#development](https://babeljs.slack.com/messages/development)/[#discussion](https://babeljs.slack.com/messages/discussion) slack rooms. (Sign up at [slack.babeljs.io](http://slack.babeljs.io/))

## Old Notes (2016)

> When we didn't have "meetings", but just notes to discuss development.
> These notes started July 30, 2016.
