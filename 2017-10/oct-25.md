## Done

- [x] Move to scoped packages https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/6495

`babel-cli` -> `@babel/cli`
`babel-preset-env` -> `@babel/preset-env`: shorthand in `.babelrc` is: `@babel/env`
`babel-plugin-xyz` -> `@babel/plugin-xyz`: shorthand in `.babelrc` is: `@babel/xyz`

- [x] Move to peerDeps on babel-core https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/6549 https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/6569

All plugins/presets/top level user pkgs will have a peerDep on `babel-core`.
This is the same behavior as `babel-loader` currently, but it will apply for `gulp-babel`, `babel-cli`, etc

- [x] Rename proposal plugins to `-proposal` instead of `-transform` https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/6570

Example: `@babel/plugin-transform-class-properties` -> `@babel/proposal-transform-class-properties`

When a proposal becomes Stage 4, we will signify the change by renaming it back to `transform`.

## Doing

- [ ] Still need to move babel-preset-env issues/PRs over to the main repo
- [ ] Move babylon into the monorepo https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/6484
- [ ] Renamed all plugins to not need have a year prefix like `-es2015-`, `-es3-`: https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/6575

## Waiting On

- [ ] Use new MIT Licensed `regenerator` (@zpao asked already)
  - [ ] Need to update `babel-types` in `regenerator` as well
